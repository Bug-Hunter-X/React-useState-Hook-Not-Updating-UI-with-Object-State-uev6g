This bug is related to the usage of the `useState` hook in React. The issue arises when you try to update the state with a value that is different from the current state, but React's internal state reconciliation mechanism doesn't recognize the change, resulting in the UI not updating accordingly. This often happens when working with objects or arrays. 

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState({ value: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    setCount({ value: count.value + 1 }); // This might not update the UI
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count.value}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
